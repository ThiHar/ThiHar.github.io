	'I can write a saga',
	'I wish elves existed!',
	'You have a twin!',

	'PRETENDING TO BE SOMEWHERE!',
	'aw cool.. yes it is a lot to take in',
	'well it is pretty tough reading and doing psychology',
	'Philosophy sounds so good. Had the fortune of touching a bit on greek and roman roots.. I think I am gonna give us psych and become a mythologist. This is in-congruence!',
	'well im perfectly useless',
	'Im fun at parties, tho!',
	'woah! well you ARE MADE FOR THIS!',
	'I am pretty clueless as to what I want.. ( yeah I know it sounds perfectly careless)',

	'Yes sounds like a perfect human but if that makes you happy who am I to judge ^_^',
	'Do you not see how people grumble that roses have thorns instead of being grateful that thorns have roses? We tend to unnecessarily emphasize the defective aspects of our nature for some reason.. and be ashamed of it.. while I just think all the shortcomings make us more "human" and our lives more tragic. If you were not as self centred (I am not saying that you are but since you are ascertain of the fact) or if you were not bit of a psychopath.. I suppose you will be strikingly different from the rest of us self centred psychopaths.. (but twisted in various ways) ^_^ so you are fine or nah? Youare finee. You just do not have to point it out. If I go on pointing out all my flaws.. yawwwn- I can break your recordüòÇ buuut thats not necessary. Let uss focus on the roses, not the thorns. You my dear Ser, should agree with me given your preference for the humanistic perspective over the psycodynamics ( plus you render me speechless, I had to think and rethink and think again yet did not come up anything sensible) Be comfortable in your own skin, it is very genuine and far more attractive than being an all-perfect being who can not relate to other humans!

	'A philosophy is necessary but why on earth should two people rant and rave and kill each other based on differing opinions',
	'So many differing philosophis clashing in together. So many different values and morals each unique to a separate person..',

	'the moment I start considering myself a brainiac will be the end of me..' ,
