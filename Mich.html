  "Believe you can and you're halfway there.",
  'Really confusing right now.',
	'Oh but it is surprisingly good',
	'I will rather manage on my own',
	'What I am saying is, we can not ignore that there are some things beyond the control of free will and the ideal self',
	'Im effing tired of psychology pin pointing all the defects of humans',
	'Sometimes it is overwhelming. It is nice to feel that sense of control.. in believing the concept of free will.',
	'You know what, sometimes I have no clue as to what I am talking about',
	'Such an escapist I am',
	'There is a lot going on, you see',
	'You are never alone, Atleast not in your imagination.',
	'You are pretty interesting',
	'Yes I have trouble articulating, so it was very awkward for me',
	'Perspective is indeed, everything.',
	'Not now. I am glad I grew up',
	'Hahaa omg I have a melatonin deficiency I am sure',
	'You mean, you are lucky!',
	'No are you not the king/queen of your own realm?',
	'Speaking for myself, I own a dragon too.',
	'But more of a dethroned queen, I guess',
	'I can write a saga',
	'I wish elves existed!',
	'You have a twin!',
	'Ah my preference for drama!!',
	'Well my family was brutally massacred so I"ll never know. Enduring all the sufferings alone!',
	'Could never fit in',
	'PRETENDING TO BE SOMEWHERE!',
	'aw cool.. yes it is a lot to take in',
	'well it is pretty tough reading and doing psychology',
	'Philosophy sounds so good. Had the fortune of touching a bit on greek and roman roots.. I think I am gonna give us psych and become a mythologist. This is in-congruence!',
	'well im perfectly useless',
	'Im fun at parties, tho!',
	'woah! well you ARE MADE FOR THIS!',
	'I am pretty clueless as to what I want.. ( yeah I know it sounds perfectly careless)',
	'Trust me, mutter to yourself that you are gonna be fine ^_^',
	'Perhaps I was drunk when I decided. But wait, I am so booring and I do not drink',
	'You love stories. I have TONS of stories',
	'Actually yeah being honest, I just wanted to figure out what is wrong with me',
	'but tell me, why do you consider yourself to be different from all the other peers?',
	'That I find really baffling since you sound perfectly fine. FINEEE. yeah.',
	'Damn you sound like a brainy kid.',
	'When I was in school all I did was daydream and wait for a knight in a shinning armour (yeah I know clich√©d) although these days I might relentlessly deny that I have been once that na√Øve',

	'I like being spontaneous',
	'And enjoy the simplest of things. We make everything so complex and its tiring',
	'The world is fine without its picture painted by me',
	'It is 2016 and everyone is offended by something, everyone wants to get mad. Everyone is scared of stating what they want truly want to.',
	'Yes sounds like a perfect human but if that makes you happy who am I to judge ^_^',
	'Do you not see how people grumble that roses have thorns instead of being grateful that thorns have roses? We tend to unnecessarily emphasize the defective aspects of our nature for some reason.. and be ashamed of it.. while I just think all the shortcomings make us more "human" and our lives more tragic. If you were not as self centred (I am not saying that you are but since you are ascertain of the fact) or if you were not bit of a psychopath.. I suppose you will be strikingly different from the rest of us self centred psychopaths.. (but twisted in various ways) ^_^ so you are fine or nah? Youare finee. You just do not have to point it out. If I go on pointing out all my flaws.. yawwwn- I can break your recordüòÇ buuut thats not necessary. Let uss focus on the roses, not the thorns. You my dear Ser, should agree with me given your preference for the humanistic perspective over the psycodynamics ( plus you render me speechless, I had to think and rethink and think again yet did not come up anything sensible) Be comfortable in your own skin, it is very genuine and far more attractive than being an all-perfect being who can not relate to other humans! Phew and imagine, this is why the immortals envy us!',
	'Who am I? A dethroned queen on a bloody quest for vengeance! I will take back what is mine by birth',

	'I was not born to be subtle',
	'I do not know suddenly I am all morbidüòÅ what the hell is going on!?',
	'A philosophy is necessary but why on earth should two people rant and rave and kill each other based on differing opinions',
	'So many differing philosophis clashing in together. So many different values and morals each unique to a separate person..',
	'But imagine an advanced race of humans who are able to leave the notion of religion behind. They would not surely destroy themselves just so',
	'That looks weird or is it just me',
	'You are hugely dissapointed are you not',
	'It does not get any girly than this',
	'Suggest me some books',
	'ReallyüòÇ I love misery!',
	'Damn I woke up feeling so energetic now I am drained',
	'well true that, i suppose everyone is a bit narcissistic and a healthy dose of narcissism is actually healthy',
	'although there is a thin line between loving thyself and narcissism',
	'what is up? my mind wanders and it is pretty hard to pin everything down.',

	'hahaha this notion is recurring- that you are not likable.',
	'to be honest, you are the upgraded version of me, sometimes! The more rational and the intelligent version! :D maybe that is why it is very easy to open up! (don"t be offended, given the comparison)',
	'hahaha! no you are quite.. let me see! " you have rather the look of another world" - that is the only quote i can remember! when it comes to you',
	'see this is why youre the upgraded version! You are quite unfathomable',
	'the thing is, i dont even know who I am! pretty scary that my self identity is not formally developed!',
	'I dont even know my cardinal trait.. im very disorganized!',
	'I crave to someone else, rather than my true self,, not out of disappointment but for reasons unknown...in the process, I somehow ended up confused...',
	'but nah, the costs of being an escapist is.....high.',
	'Okay infants are way more effed up than I originally imagined!',
	'I guess all of us feel a bit "meeh" sometimes but well we have to be those so called social beings ARGH',
	'I like other people in costumes, but not myself',
	'I want to see myself through eyes of other people ..',

	'Good lord so many ambitions!!',
	'I do want to work with kids one day, Since I will not have any!',
	'I suppose we all look for fanfiction in order to fulfill our own wishes!',
	'somebody called me a brainiac and i was surprised :o he violated the word by calling me one!',
	'I suppose I will never be happy the more you know, the more you think you are ignorant There are a looooooooooooot of things that im blissfully aware of! what.. i mean unaware of**',
	'the moment I start considering myself a brainiac will be the end of me..' ,
	'do you like attention? it bothers me as hell, feels like everyone is watching you and it is nauseous',
	'yes but ofcourse if my friends dont give me attention I get mad~',
